              <div class="about-text">
                  <p>Hot Beans Web was established in 2007 by David Wood, who previously held roles in a multi-national business. He saw that there was a potential for a slightly different type of Web Design Agency;
                    David wanted to create a web design agency that could deliver on the fundamentals of providing good quality websites at affordable prices without compromising on quality.
                    Over a decade and a half later, it has proven to be a successful formula; we have seen the business grow year on year for both Hot Beans and our clients. We have our head office in Peterborough and offices in Northampton.</p>
                    
                  <h3>Our Trusting Clients</h3>
                  
                  <p>Our clients base include many different types and sizes of business, ranging from the sole trader to SME's all the way through to household names.
